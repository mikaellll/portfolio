## Introduction
Traditional annual budgets often become obsolete within months. Businesses need a **flexible and continuous planning method** to adapt to changing market conditions. This is where the **Rolling Forecast** comes in. Unlike static budgets, it provides a dynamic view of the company's financial future.

A rolling forecast allows organizations to **update projections regularly**, improving decision-making, resource allocation, and strategic planning.

## 1. What is a Rolling Forecast?

- Always covers the next 12–18 months  
- Updated monthly or quarterly  
- Focused on **key drivers** of performance rather than fixed line items  
- Helps anticipate risks and opportunities

## 6. Example of a Rolling Forecast in Practice

Imagine a SaaS company projecting revenue over 12 months.  

| Month   | Revenue Forecast ($) | Actual ($) | Variance ($) |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Jan     | 100,000           | 95,000    | -5,000       |
| Feb     | 102,000           | 105,000   | +3,000       |
| Mar     | 104,000           | 98,000    | -6,000       |

After March, the rolling forecast updates projections for April–March next year, using actuals from Jan–Mar to refine assumptions.
