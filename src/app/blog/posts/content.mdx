## Introduction
In any organization, simply setting a budget is not enough. To control performance effectively, managers need to **compare actual results against the budget or forecast**. This process is called **Variance Analysis**.

Variance analysis helps identify **why results differ from expectations**, enabling corrective actions and better decision-making.

## 1. What is Variance Analysis?

**Variance Analysis** is the process of calculating and interpreting the difference between **planned (budgeted) and actual performance**.  

- Positive variance → actual results are better than planned  
- Negative variance → actual results are worse than planned  

It can apply to **revenue, costs, production, and operational metrics**.

## 2. Types of Variances

1. **Revenue Variance**  
   - Difference between budgeted and actual revenue  
   - Causes: price changes, sales volume variation, product mix  

2. **Cost Variance**  
   - Difference between budgeted and actual costs  
   - Can be **Fixed Cost Variance** or **Variable Cost Variance**  
   - Helps identify overspending or efficiency issues  

3. **Profit Variance**  
   - Difference between expected and actual profit  
   - Combines revenue and cost variances to assess overall financial performance  

4. **Operational Variance**  
   - Differences in KPIs like production efficiency, labor hours, or inventory usage  
   - Useful for non-financial performance control

## 3. Formula for Variance

### Simple formula:

Variance = Actual Result - Budgeted Result


- Positive = favorable  
- Negative = unfavorable  

### Example:

| Metric       | Budget ($) | Actual ($) | Variance ($) | Interpretation      |
|-------------|------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Revenue     | 50,000     | 52,000    | +2,000       | Favorable         |
| Costs       | 30,000     | 32,000    | -2,000       | Unfavorable       |
| Profit      | 20,000     | 20,000    | 0            | On target         |

## 4. Why Variance Analysis Matters

- **Identify problems early:** Detect areas of overspending or underperformance  
- **Improve planning:** Refine future budgets and forecasts based on past performance  
- **Support decision-making:** Take corrective actions quickly  
- **Enhance accountability:** Track department or project performance

## 5. Common Causes of Variances

- **Volume changes:** Sales more or less than planned  
- **Price changes:** Market fluctuations affecting revenue or costs  
- **Efficiency issues:** Labor or material inefficiency  
- **Unexpected events:** Economic changes, supply chain disruptions
