## Introduction
In management control, understanding how to assign responsibility and measure performance is essential. Two important concepts are **Cost Centers** and **Profit Centers**. Each plays a different role in organizational control and decision-making.

- **Cost Centers** focus on controlling expenses.  
- **Profit Centers** focus on generating profits.  

Properly defining these units allows managers to **track accountability, improve performance, and align departments with organizational goals**.

## 1. Cost Centers

A **Cost Center** is a department or unit whose primary responsibility is to **control costs** rather than generate revenue.

**Examples:**  
- IT Department  
- Human Resources  
- Facilities / Maintenance  

**Key Characteristics:**  
- Responsible for minimizing costs while maintaining quality.  
- Performance measured against budgeted costs.  
- Does not directly generate revenue.

**Formula for evaluating performance:**  


**Example:**  

| Department | Budget ($) | Actual ($) | Variance ($) | Performance |
|------------|------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| IT         | 50,000     | 52,000    | -2,000       | Over budget |
| HR         | 30,000     | 28,000    | +2,000       | Under budget |

## 2. Profit Centers

A **Profit Center** is a department or unit responsible for both **revenue generation and cost management**.  

**Examples:**  
- Sales Department  
- Product Line  
- Branch Offices  

**Key Characteristics:**  
- Measured based on profitability.  
- Can make decisions to maximize contribution margin.  
- Encourages accountability for both income and expenses.

**Example:**  

| Department | Revenue ($) | Costs ($) | Profit ($) | Performance |
|------------|------------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Sales A    | 100,000    | 70,000    | 30,000     | Target met |
| Product B  | 150,000    | 120,000   | 30,000     | Needs improvement |
