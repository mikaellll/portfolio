Introduction

Every business needs to know when it will start making money. This is the point where revenues cover all costs—the break-even point (BEP). Understanding the BEP is essential for pricing, budgeting, decision-making, and strategic planning.

Without it, companies risk operating blindly, either underpricing products or overestimating profitability.

## What is the Break-even Point?

The break-even point is the level of sales at which total revenues equal total costs.

Below this point → the business incurs a loss

At this point → the business is neutral (no profit, no loss)

Above this point → the business generates profit

It helps management understand how much must be sold to cover fixed and variable costs.

## Components of Break-even Analysis

To calculate the break-even point, you need three key components:

Fixed Costs (FC)

Costs that do not change with production volume

Examples: rent, salaries, insurance

Variable Costs (VC)

Costs that change directly with production or sales volume

Examples: raw materials, packaging, shipping

Selling Price per Unit (SP)

The revenue earned for each unit sold

Formula:

Break-even (units)
=
Fixed Costs
Selling Price per Unit
−
Variable Cost per Unit
Break-even (units)=
Selling Price per Unit−Variable Cost per Unit
Fixed Costs
	​

## Why Break-even Analysis Matters

Pricing strategy: Determines the minimum price to cover costs

Decision making: Helps decide whether to launch a product or project

Cost control: Highlights the impact of fixed and variable costs on profitability

Planning: Sets realistic sales targets to achieve profitability

## Example of Break-even Calculation

Imagine a company selling a product:

Fixed Costs = $50,000

Variable Cost per unit = $20

Selling Price per unit = $50

Break-even units:

𝐵
𝐸
𝑃
=
50
,
000
50
−
20
=

 units
BEP=
50−20
50,000
	​

=
30
50,000
	​

≈1,667 units

The company must sell 1,667 units to cover all costs. Any sales above this number generate profit.

5. Break-even in Revenue Terms

Sometimes, it’s easier to look at sales revenue instead of units:

𝐵
𝐸
𝑃
 (revenue)
=
Break-even units
×
Selling Price per Unit
BEP (revenue)=Break-even units×Selling Price per Unit

Using the previous example:

𝐵
𝐸
𝑃
 (revenue)
=
1
,
667
×
50
≈
83
,
350
BEP (revenue)=1,667×50≈83,350

So, the company must generate $83,350 in sales to break even.

6. Advanced Considerations

Multiple products: Weighted average contribution margin needed

Changes in costs or prices: Regular updates required

Margin of safety: Measures how far current sales are from the BEP

Graphical representation: Useful for quick visual understanding of costs, revenues, and profits

## Conclusion

The break-even point is a cornerstone of financial and operational planning.
It helps managers and entrepreneurs understand how many units must be sold or how much revenue must be earned to cover costs, providing a clear target for achieving profitability.

By regularly monitoring the BEP, companies can make informed pricing, investment, and production decisions, ensuring financial sustainability and smarter growth.
