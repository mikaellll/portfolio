## Introduction
Understanding costs is critical for making informed business decisions. Two major costing methods are used in management control: **Full Costing (Coût Complet)** and **Variable Costing (Coût Variable)**. Each method provides different insights into profitability, pricing, and decision-making. Choosing the right method allows managers to **analyze costs accurately, optimize pricing, and improve financial performance**.

---

## 1. Full Costing (Coût Complet)
**Full Costing** includes **all production costs** in the cost of a product:

- **Fixed Costs:** Rent, salaries, depreciation  
- **Variable Costs:** Raw materials, direct labor, packaging  

**Formula:**  
Full Cost per Unit = (Total Fixed Costs + Total Variable Costs) / Number of Units Produced

**Example:**  

| Item                  | Amount ($) |
|----------------------|------------|
| Fixed Costs           | 50,000     |
| Variable Costs        | 30,000     |
| Units Produced        | 4,000      |
| Full Cost per Unit    | 20         |

---

## 2. Variable Costing (Coût Variable)
**Variable Costing** considers **only variable costs** in product costing:

- **Variable Costs:** Raw materials, direct labor, packaging  
- **Fixed Costs:** Treated as period expenses, not assigned to products  

**Formula:**  
Variable Cost per Unit = Total Variable Costs / Number of Units Produced

**Example:**  

| Item                   | Amount ($) |
|------------------------|------------|
| Variable Costs          | 30,000     |
| Units Produced          | 4,000      |
| Variable Cost per Unit  | 7.5        |

## 3. Full Costing vs Variable Costing Comparison

| Feature                 | Full Costing               | Variable Costing          |
|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Costs Included          | Fixed + Variable          | Only Variable            |
| Use                     | Long-term pricing, reporting | Short-term decisions, contribution analysis |
| Profit Reporting        | Includes fixed costs      | Excludes fixed costs     |
| Decision-Making Focus   | Total cost recovery       | Contribution margin & incremental decisions |
| Best For                | Financial accounting, statutory reporting | Management decisions, operational analysis |

## 4. Contribution Margin Concept
Variable costing is closely linked to the **contribution margin**:

Contribution Margin = Sales Revenue - Variable Costs

**Example:**  
- Sales Revenue = $60,000  
- Variable Costs = $30,000  

Contribution Margin = 60,000 - 30,000 = 30,000  

This $30,000 first covers fixed costs; anything above is profit.

## 5. Graphical Representation (ASCII)

- `*` = Full Costing break-even point  
- Area below `*` = Loss  
- Area above `*` = Profit  
- Variable costing shows contribution margin before covering fixed costs  

---

## 6. When to Use Each Method
- **Full Costing:** Required for external reporting, long-term pricing, and compliance with accounting standards.  
- **Variable Costing:** Ideal for **short-term decisions**, analyzing product profitability, and understanding contribution margin.

---

## Conclusion
Understanding the difference between **Full Costing and Variable Costing** is essential for management control.  

- **Full Costing** gives a complete view of product costs for long-term planning and reporting.  
- **Variable Costing** emphasizes decision-making, contribution margin, and operational profitability.

Using both methods strategically allows managers to **make better pricing, production, and investment decisions**.
