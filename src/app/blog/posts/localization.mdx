## Introduction
When a company sells **multiple products**, calculating the break-even point becomes more complex. A **Weighted Break-even Point (Seuil de rentabilité pondéré)** considers the **contribution of each product** to total revenue, allowing managers to **plan more accurately and optimize profitability**.

This method is essential for companies with diverse product lines or services.

## 1. Concept of Weighted Break-even Point
For multiple products, the break-even point depends on:

- The **selling price** of each product  
- The **variable cost** of each product  
- The **proportion of sales** (sales mix)  

The **weighted contribution margin** accounts for the mix:


Where:  
- Contribution Margin per Product = Selling Price - Variable Cost  
- Sales Mix = Proportion of each product in total sales

## 2. Formula


**Interpretation:**  
This gives the **number of units (combined across products)** that need to be sold to cover all fixed costs.

## 3. Example

A company sells **3 products**:

| Product | Selling Price ($) | Variable Cost ($) | Contribution Margin ($) | Sales Mix (%) |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------|
| A       | 50              | 30              | 20                     | 50%           |
| B       | 40              | 20              | 20                     | 30%           |
| C       | 30              | 10              | 20                     | 20%           |

**Weighted Contribution Margin:**  


If **Total Fixed Costs = $100,000**:  


This means the company must sell **5,000 units in total**, according to the sales mix, to break even.

## 5. Practical Tips

1. **Update regularly:** Adjust for changes in sales mix or costs.  
2. **Focus on high-margin products:** Optimize contribution to reduce overall break-even units.  
3. **Integrate with dashboards:** Use Excel, Power BI, or Python to automate calculations.  
4. **Combine with KPIs:** Track contribution margin ratio, break-even percentage, and margin of safety.  
5. **Scenario planning:** Test best-case, worst-case, and base-case sales mixes.

## Conclusion
The **Weighted Break-even Point** provides a more realistic view of profitability for companies with multiple products. By considering **contribution margins and sales mix**, managers can **set strategic targets, optimize product focus, and make informed financial decisions**.  

This method complements standard break-even analysis, giving a **more accurate picture of financial sustainability and growth potential**.
